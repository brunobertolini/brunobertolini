## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I've been a Web Developer since 2006, and I've worked as a front-end, back-end, mobile, full stack and tech leader in several startups and companies of all sizes.

**My current core stack is based on the JavaScript** ecosystem, with NodeJS, KoaJS, Prisma, React, React Native, TailwindCSS, NextJS and Vercel, but I have a lot of experience with AWS services, Docker, CI/CD in general, serverless and some other cool stuff.

Since 2019, I've been **constantly creating content** in Portuguese, on [Instagram](https://codar.me/instagram) and [Youtube](https://codar.me/youtube) through [Codar.me](https://codar.me), a company that I create with my wife to teach developers how to develop real software. In total, we've helped over 70k developers and counting!

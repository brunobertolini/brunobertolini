# Hey, I'm Bruno 👋

I turn complexity into working products.

20+ years shipping software. I cut scope, shrink teams, and deliver fast. At Setta, I shipped an MVP in 2 months with 1 dev — what the product + tech team couldn't do in 6. At Juntos Somos Mais, I delivered 2 mobile apps with 2 devs in 15 days.
Currently building products with Next.js, React, Node.js, TypeScript, Prisma, and AI SDK.
Through Codar.me, I've helped 70k+ developers learn to build real software.
